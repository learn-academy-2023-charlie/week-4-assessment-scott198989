# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object Oriented Programming, OOP, basically says that everything is a object, where as functional programming is everything can be defined by a function

Researched answer: I learned that OOP consists of different objects with their own charecteristics, and can perform their own methods, whereas functional programming you have a set amount of data that follows a series of steps in a function to get the desired result

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: a Interger wouold be considered a whole number like 1, 2, 3 and a float would be a number with a decimal like 1.2, 1.3, 1.4

Researched answer: Intergers and floats are similar in the sense that they are both numbers, but a float has a decimal attatched to it.  That is the key difference.  

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: You do not have to have a return statement like in JS.  

Researched answer: When you write a method or block in Ruby, the last line of code within that method or block is considered the return value.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: a block of code, simply put.   

Researched answer: a chunck of code you can pass around and associate with a method call.  

5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: to get a value from a specific key

Researched answer: to retrieve the value associated with a specific key in the hash. You can use square brackets [] with the key to extract the corresponding value from the hash, and the fetch method allows you to extract a value from a hash by specifying the key.   

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: a tool that helps you test your Ruby code to make sure it works as expected

2. Test-driven development: by writing and testing the code first, you have a clear goal in mind and can focus on writing code to meet the desired result

3. PostgreSQL: database system that helps you store and manage your data

4. CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete - constantly re-evaulting code and making changes and disgarding old code

5. HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's like the language that web browsers and servers use to communicate with each other.
